Refactoring some class based projects to brush up on React Hooks. üßø  

This one using the YouTube API. üí•

Swap out any API though and you pretty much get a bare bones search app! Just replace my video components with whatever components you need i.e articles works well with wikipedia api. ü§æüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Test by downloading and running on localhost or at the following: 

üëã https://hardcore-williams-bfcc00.netlify.app/ üëã


Making use of semantic UI for grid https://semantic-ui.com/ and axios for the API call. Other than that it's pretty bare bones.

Also making my own hook alongside the usual primitives. 
Making use of throttling and debouncing to improve performance and search experience:

Configured the API to run on https://localhost:3000 and above domain only. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
